minOPOSD is an add-on to the ArduCamOSD/MinimOSD-Extra project.

With this add-on you can use the MinimOSD hardware in combination with a flight control from OpenPilot like CC3D and Revo which uses UAVTalk as communication protocol.

It is intended as a temporary solution for the FPV guys till the OpenPilot OSD is available.

This project is GNU GPL v3 and using it is at your own risk.
